                    <p class = "p-indent project-desc">Velocify is a Windows based desktop application built with C# and WinForms that helps users 
                        optimize their in-game settings based on their PC’s hardware and real-time network conditions. The app automatically detects
                         CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage specifications and uses that data to recommend ideal game configurations for performance and visual
                          quality. The video game information is pulled from the IGDB API, while user accounts, preferences, and game settings are 
                          stored locally using SQLite. This project was developed as a senior project to combine hardware detection, gaming optimization,
                           and network diagnostics into a single, user-friendly application.</p>

                         tasks using Python and PowerShell. It simplifies repetitive processes such as unlocking user accounts and retrieving user details
                          by taking basic input (like a username) and performing backend operations automatically. The tool integrates Python’s subprocess
                           module to run PowerShell commands securely, providing quick responses without needing to manually access Active Directory tools
                            and reducing the response time for frequent tickets/tasks. This script demonstrates practical automation for IT administrative
                             environments as well as highlights my ability to bridge scripting with real-world IT workflows.</p>

                    <p class = "p-indent project-desc">My movie recommendation web app is a full-stack application that recommends a movie based on the user’s
                         selection of up to four favorites. Built using Flask for the backend and JavaScript with HTML/CSS on the frontend, it communicates
                          with the TMDB API to retrieve movie metadata like titles, posters, and overviews. The app processes user input to suggest a similar
                           movie, using a content-based filtering approach to analyze genre and thematic similarity. Users receive instant results displayed
                            with images and descriptions, making the experience both interactive and visually engaging. The backend logic handles movie comparison
                             and dynamically serves the final recommendation to the front end. This project highlights API integration, backend-to-frontend data
                              flow, and custom recommendation logic. It is a lightweight but functional demonstration of full-stack development using Python and
                               JavaScript.</p>

                          sectioned layout that highlights each project with short descriptions and links to source code or live demos. Google Fonts and a custom
                           color palette give the site a modern, professional aesthetic. The site is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
                            It serves as a central hub where visitors can learn about my work, read about each project, and easily contact me through a form or email
                             link. The goal was to present my work in a straightforward, visually appealing way while demonstrating basic front-end skills. </p>
